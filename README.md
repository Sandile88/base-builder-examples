# Base Projects Lab

Welcome to my journey learning and building apps on [Base](https://base.org) using tools like [OnchainKit](https://github.com/CoinbaseBuilders/onchainkit), Foundry, and more.

This repository is a collection of **mini projects** I will be building while exploring the Base L2 ecosystem. Each project is self-contained and includes its own `README.md` with setup instructions.

## Why This Repo?

I’m using this repo to document:
- What I learn as I build
- What worked and what didn’t
- Tips for getting started with Base

Each folder includes my notes, code, and useful commands so others can follow along or build their own versions.
